## Phase 1 — Foundation & App Shell

**Goal:** Working app skeleton with design system, data layer, agent login, and navigation. No lead features yet — just the bones.

| Deliverable | Files | Features |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Vite + React project | `package.json`, `vite.config.js` | Project scaffold |
| Design system CSS | `src/index.css` | All tokens from design.md (colors, typography, spacing, shadows, animations) |
| Data layer | `src/store/` | Zustand stores, LocalStorage persistence, seed data (3 agents, 15 leads, 8 properties) |
| Agent selector | `src/pages/Login.jsx` | Screen 1: Click avatar to "login" as Rajan/Rohan/Priya/Amit |
| App shell | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/` | Header (logo, nav, helpline badge, agent switcher), Sidebar (filters), Routing |
| Indian formatters | `src/utils/` | `formatINR()`, `formatPhone()`, `formatDate()`, `formatArea()` |

**Exit criteria:** Can open the app, select an agent, see the header with helpline number, navigate between empty pages (Dashboard, Leads, Properties, Visits, Calls).

---

```

> **Phases 3 and 4 can run in parallel** after Phase 2 is complete — they only share the lead data model and detail drawer, which Phase 2 delivers.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| dnd kit complexity for 9 Kanban columns | Medium | Start with simplified 4-column demo, expand to 9 after basic DnD works |
| LocalStorage size limit (~5MB) | Low | 500 leads × 2KB = ~1MB. Well within limits for MVP team size. |
| Mobile Kanban horizontal scroll UX | Medium | Test on real 360px devices early in Phase 5 |
| Recharts bundle size | Low | Tree-shake to only import BarChart, PieChart, ResponsiveContainer |

---

*Each phase is designed to deliver a working, demonstrable increment. Phase 1 alone gives you a clickable app shell. Phase 2 alone gives you a usable CRM.*
